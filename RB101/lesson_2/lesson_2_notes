Lesson 2 Notes

1) Pass by Reference = Mutable / destructive (!)
    -> Value associated to object ID can be reassigned.
    -> Example: Arrays, array methods & setters (like array objects)

2) Pass by Value = Immutable
    -> nothing has been mutated
    -> Value associated to object ID cannot be reassigned.
    -> w/ variables, the value & object was reassigned, not mutated.
    -> Example: numbers and booleans

3) Methods take precedence before blocks, but using the "yield" command w/ a block 
can allow it to move outside the value and run the block.
    -> w/out "yield" and having 1 method & 1 block, only the method will be executed. 

4) Multiline text to print, use `<<-TEXT...TEXT`

5) w/ recursion, your want to return right after calling it in your method if you don'to
want it to run a second time.

6) %w(string array) or %i(symbol array)
